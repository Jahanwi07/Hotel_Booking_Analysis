Analysis Summary: Hotel Booking Cancellations and ADR Trends
This analysis investigates booking cancellations and trends in Average Daily Rate (ADR) within the hospitality industry, focusing on customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Using a publicly available dataset, we examined seasonal patterns, demographics, and key factors influencing cancellations to derive actionable insights for hotel management.

Key Findings:
Seasonality in Bookings:

Bookings peak from May to August, suggesting high demand during summer months, while January experiences a notable drop.
Resort hotels see a significant rise in ADR in July, which then decreases before rising again in January, likely due to seasonal vacation trends. City hotels, however, show steadier ADRs, indicating consistent demand from business and urban travelers.
Customer Demographics and Booking Patterns:

The analysis uncovered various trends in customer behavior, with certain demographics showing higher cancellation rates, potentially influenced by lead time and booking source.
Cancellation Insights:

Cancellations were more common among guests booking far in advance or through certain distribution channels.
Hypothesis testing confirmed that bookings made over six months in advance were more likely to cancel, with weekday bookings having a slightly higher ADR than weekends.
Predictive Modeling:

An optimized model was developed to predict cancellations with a recall of 81.82%, ensuring most cancellations are accurately captured. However, the precision of 40.41% suggests that some false positives occur, highlighting a need for careful interpretation.
Recommendations:
Pricing Strategy: Adjust ADR based on seasonality, raising rates during peak months for resorts and offering targeted promotions in the off-peak January period.
Customer Segmentation: Focus marketing on demographics less prone to cancellations and leverage insights on booking channels to minimize risk.
Operational Planning: Optimize staffing and resources to align with demand fluctuations, ensuring sufficient support during high-occupancy periods.
This analysis provides a foundation for informed decision-making, helping hotel managers strategically plan for seasonal trends, enhance customer satisfaction, and reduce cancellation rates.
